## THIS MOD IS STILL A WIP AND IS NOT AT VERSION 1.0 (RELEASE) YET

# M'Khiin NPC for BG2EE. 
This mod adds M'Khiin Grubdoubler, the goblin companion from Siege of Dragonspear, to BG2EE as a joinable NPC. 

## FAQ

### Q: Where can I recruit her? 

A: M'Khiin is found within the Sewers of the Temple District. Alternatively she can be summoned via the Fate Spirit in TOB. 

### Q: Are there any NPCs you recommend with her? Anyone that she fights with?

A: Haer'Dalis is a good fit, her banters with him strengthen her epilogues. M'Khiin won't leave because of any other companions, but she will find little in common with Korgan or Hexxat. 

### Q: What are your current plans for the mod? 

Version 1.0 will add M'Khiin as a joinable NPC with content equivalent to other One-Day-NPCs. 
* She banters with vanilla NPCs. 
* She comments on essential events. E.g. Tree of Life, Spellhold. 
* She interjects during dialogues.
* She has a few timer-&-scenery based dialogues to complete her short friendship track. 
* She has one mini quest - *A Goblin in the City*. This consists of two encounters where others object to her presence within Athkatla. 

### Q: You mentioned alignment changes. What's that about? 

A: M'Khiin is still finding her place within the world. With CHARNAME's encouragement she may switch her alignment to Neutral Good - after the end of the slavery quest in the Copper Coronet. If she is not encouraged to care for others she will remain True Neutral.

### Q: Why does M'Khiin seem out of character?

A: Players have their own interpretations of canon characters. While I think she remains in-character, you may feel differently. I also don't claim to perfectly replicate her speech. If you have any suggestions for improvements, I'd be delighted to hear them / implement them (with thanks and credit).

* Special thanks to [@dark0dave](https://github.com/dark0dave/BaeBG2) for writing Baeloth's crossmod lines. <3 

## LICENSING
* M'Khiin's resources are pulled from the base Siege of Dragonspear game. I don't own any of it.

* My part of the mod is open source. That means anyone is free to fork, make pull requests or alter content. While I'd prefer people approach me if they want new content (e.g. changing the lines I've written, reactions to other vanilla quests), crossmod is free real estate. You can contact me to co-write / co-code it. Or simply add the crossmod on your end without my involvement.

* M'Khiin isn't even my OC. She's a canon character I'm expanding on. Honestly -- go wild. Change the talks completely. Remove the PID. Add to the PID. Reword lines you don't like. Write your own, completely seperate M'Khiin BG2EE mod that's considerably better than mine. The sky's the limit.
